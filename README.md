This repository contains a py file which is the sample web crawler covered in class.
It also contains two ipynb web crawlers. Crawler 1 gets 10 links on the fed reserve press releases website that have the word "covid" in the page. Crawler 2 gets the first 20 links that contain the word "charges" on he SEC press releases page.
This is a class practice for web crawling. Github please do not ban my account.
